    <h3>Interactive Map</h3>
    <p>
      Displays the city of Los Angeles and its homeless population in an interactive
	  map.
    </p>
	<p>
	The collapsable Map Controls drop down has the following features:
	</p>
	<ul>
      <li>Change the homeless measure distribution by either Census Tract or Communities</li> 
      <li>Filter the homeless population by year and measure</li>
      <li>Filter the Crime counts and locations by time of day,
	  day of the week, and month of the year</li>
      <li>Filter the Call counts and locations by time of day,
	  day of the week, and month of the year</li>
    </ul>
	<p>
	Note that the 24 hour day has been split into 4 buckets:
	</p>
	<ul>
      <li>Morning: 12:00 AM to 6:00 AM</li>
	  <li>Afternoon: 6:00 AM to 12:00 PM</li> 
	  <li>Evening: 12:00 PM to 6:00 PM</li> 
	  <li>Night: 6:00 PM to 12:00 AM</li> 
    </ul>
	
	<p>
	As well, above the legend in the bottom right corner, the user can select
	the different layers to display: Homeless Measure, Shelters, Crimes, and/or
	311 calls.
	</p>

    <h3>Crimes and Calls Over Time</h3>
    <p>
      The Crimes and Calls tab displays a plot of the distribution of 311 calls
	  or crime counts across the week and then also buckets them into the time
	  of day following the above mentioned splits. Crimes can be further filtered
	  based on the type of crime from the drop down menu on the left.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusions and Recommendations</h2>
    
    <p>
	To conclude this project: we analyzed and visualized the trend of 
	homelessness and associated crimes with the merged dataset by census tract: 
    </p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Calculated the correlation between the homeless density and 311 calls.</li>
		<ul style = "list-style: none" >
				<li> a) We observed a high correlation between density and crimes counts 
					0.87 â€“ which raised the question that whether high crime rates were a 
					threat to the homeless population or were the homeless causing these crimes.
				</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Analyzed the distribution of crimes and 311 calls across time.
			<ul style = "list-style: none">
				<li>a) Number of 311 calls was the highest on Tuesday and during the afternoon hours</li>
				<li>b) Crime rate is highest on Saturday afternoon, followed by Tuesday evening and 
				Sunday afternoon and evening.</li>
				<li>c) The most frequent type of crime is Assault on Saturday afternoon</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Used our Shiny Dashboard to understand which factors could be significant for the 
		unsheltered homeless.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
	Skid row being at the top even though it has the largest number of shelter counts. Worth noting that calls 
	coming from that area are comparatively quite low and it experiences high crime counts as well. 
	</p>
	<p>
	For recommendations:
	</p>
	<ul>
				<li>Investigate and access to homeless satisfaction in shelters</li>
				<li>Analyze average age of homeless in shelters to estimate the 
				average age of the total homeless population per census tract. 
				By doing so, we can have then use this data to implement better 
				strategies and procedures to help homelessness.</li>
				<li>
				Collect more data from successful project to support the decreasing rate of unsheltered homeless.
				</li>
	</ul>
